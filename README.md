# cheap-duplex
If you do not have a scanner with a dublex ADF and you have to scan first the front sides of the documents and then insert the documents back in to scan the back sides, and then you go through all the pages and combine them in order manually, this utility will save you the hassle. It will take the front and back sides you scanned and automatically put the pages in order.

## How to run
`python merge.pyw`
